Binance Blacklist Tool
========================
Python script to update appsettings.json and add newly listed coins to the SomOnlyPairs list.

This will overwrite your appsettings.json file when you execute it.  Make sure to back it up first!

Probably only works on Linux installations, so use at your own risk.  This won't work if you have any comments in the JSON as that is not properly formatted JSON.

If you find this useful, feel free to send something.
