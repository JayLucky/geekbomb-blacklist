Binance Blacklist Tool
========================
Python script to update PTFeeder appsettings.json and add newly listed coins to the SomOnlyCoins list.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python blacklist.py
```

This will overwrite your appsettings.json file when you execute it.  Make sure to back it up first!
This won't work if you have any comments in the JSON as that is not properly formatted JSON, remove them first.
Probably only works on Linux installations, so use at your own risk.

If you find this useful, feel free to send something.
